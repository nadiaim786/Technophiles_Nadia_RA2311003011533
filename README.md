Problem Statement:
Store bought medicines contain chemicals and can be quite harmful to our body resulting in a lot of side effects. However, certain individuals necessarily need to consume medicines due to chronic diseases which are common in old age and are also inherited in certain cases. In the long run this can cause permanent damage to our organs like kidneys and liver.
Solution: For the above mentioned problem, we have come up with a solution that uses the names of different medicines and provides the equivalent herbal alternatives to it and also implement healthy recipes using those specific herbs. This will be done using generative AI, LLMs, NLP and ML.
